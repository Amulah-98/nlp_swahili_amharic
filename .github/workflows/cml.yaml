          It seems that most people on Monday make many sales than any day of the week, 
          because we can see that most of the stores have spiked up sales, on that particular 
          day of the week, and as the values go by we note that sales keep decreasing and then 
          there is a short spike on Friday. Why could that be the case?.. 
          I want to believe that on Monday people have accumulated their interests from the 
          weekend, and on Friday people are trying to purchase because that weekend they might 
          need it and they find the store is closed. Or they could be traveling too or something of that sort.
